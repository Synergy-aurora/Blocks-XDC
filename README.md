## Introducing Blocks: Your Smart Contracts Hub


### Inspiration

We posed a crucial question: _"How can we democratize blockchain technology and smart contracts, making them accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical skills?"_

The answer was **Blocks**—a platform born from the recognition that while blockchain technology promises transformative potential, its complexity often hinders its widespread adoption. We envisioned a tool that bridges the gap between sophisticated blockchain capabilities and users with no technical background, providing them with an intuitive and accessible interface to bring their decentralized applications (dApps) to life.

### About Blocks

**Blocks** is a user-friendly smart contract manager tailored for the **Open Campus Codex Blockchain**. It offers an intuitive platform for creating, deploying, managing, and analyzing smart contracts, making blockchain technology accessible to both novices and seasoned developers.

With features like no-code templates, multi-wallet integrations, and comprehensive analytics, **Blocks** is set to democratize blockchain development and pave the way for a more decentralized digital future.

## Technical Details

### Architecture Overview


#### Web Application & APIs

- The front-end is crafted in **React** with **NextJS**, while core functionalities are powered by NodeJS. Our applications are hosted on [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com).

#### Compiler

- We utilize [Solidity Compiler (Solc)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc) to transform Solidity code into Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) and bytecode.

#### Contract Interactions/Deployments

- [Web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js) handles all contract interactions and deployments.

#### Offchain Database

- Encrypted messages and application operations are stored in our offchain database hosted on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) using Firestore.

### Process Flow


#### Wallet Connection & Authentication

- Users connect to the Open Campus Codex Blockchain via wallet providers like MetaMask, sign a message for authentication, and receive a JWT token for API access.

#### App Creation

- Users create their first app—an organized container for managing smart contracts. Multiple apps can be created and managed.

#### Contract Setup & Compilation

- Setting up a contract is streamlined: select a template, customize details, review and compile the code.

#### Deployment

- Deploy compiled contracts with a single click. Monitor transaction data and gain insights from the blockchain.
